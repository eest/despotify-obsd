despotify-obsd?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
This is the despotify client (http://despotify.se) tweaked in order to build
and run on OpenBSD. None of the currently involved people have any connections
to the original despotify developers (thanks a lot for your time and effort
creating despotify!).

Requirements?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
OS:
    OpenBSD 5.0 (uses wprintf/vswprintf)
Packages:
    gmake
    libao
    libogg
    libtool
    libvorbis
    mpg123

Source code
~~~~~~~~~~~
$ git clone https://github.com/eest/despotify-obsd.git

Build instructions for the clients and library
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
1. Install necessary packages (as root)
   # pkg_add gmake libao libogg libtool libvorbis mpg123

2. Go to the directory src/ where the despotify library and client is located
   $ cd src

3. Run gmake
   $ gmake

4. Install (as root)
   # gmake install

5. You'll now have a 'despotify' and 'despotify-simple' client as well as a
gateway called 'despotify-gateway' installed under /usr/local/bin.
