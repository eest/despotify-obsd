despotify-obsd?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
This is an OpenBSD port of the despotify client (http://despotify.se).
None of the currently involved people have any connections to the original
despotify developers (thanks a lot for your time and effort creating
despotify!).

Requirements?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
OS:
    OpenBSD 5.0< (uses wprintf/vswprintf)

Source code
~~~~~~~~~~~
$ git clone https://github.com/eest/despotify-obsd.git

Building the port (as root)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
# cp -r despotify-obsd/openbsd /usr/ports/audio/despotify
# cd /usr/ports/audio/despotify
# make install clean

You'll now have a 'despotify' and 'despotify-simple' client as well as a
gateway called 'despotify-gateway' installed under /usr/local/bin.
