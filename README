Despotify - the open source Spotify client
http://despotify.se/


despotify-obsd?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
This is the despotify client tweaked in order to build and run on
OpenBSD. None of the currently involved people have any connections
to the original developers.


Requirements?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
OS:
    OpenBSD 5.0 (uses wprintf/vswprintf)
Packages:
    gmake
    libao
    libogg
    libtool
    libvorbis


Source code
~~~~~~~~~~~
The latest version of the source code can be checked out from our Subversion repository
  $ svn checkout https://despotify.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/despotify despotify


Directories
~~~~~~~~~~~
The checked out source code contains a number of directories
  java/		This is where one of the available Java implementations go
  src/		This is where the C based client, library and Python bindings go
  web/		This is where the source code for our web site goes (http://despotify.se)


If you encounter any problems, ask a friend or ask in the channel
#despotify on EFNet (example EFNet servers: irc.swepipe.se, efnet.xs4all.nl)


Build instructions for the simple client and library
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
1. Install necessary packages (as root)
   # pkg_add gmake libao libogg libtool libvorbis

2. Go to the directory src/ where the despotify library and client is located
   $ cd src

2. Run gmake
   $ gmake

3. Install (as root)
   # gmake install

4. You'll now have a client called 'despotify-simple' and a gateway called 'gateway'
   installed under ${INSTALL_PREFIX}/bin (usually this will be /usr/bin)
